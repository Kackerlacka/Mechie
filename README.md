# Mechie - An Overview
Mechanical Engineering Tool

A tool for engineers that includes explanations of complex concepts across various subjects like physics, chemistry, 
mechanics, materials, thermal engineering, as well as all relevant equations and constants, and tools such as metal, wood, and plastic 
properties, bolt sizing tools, unit conversions, etc.

# Hierarchy of the app

## Concepts
Explanations and examples of laws, theories, criterion, etc, in various subjects like physics, chemistry, mechanics, thermal engineering, math, and more.

## Equations
A list of just about every relevant equation I can find.

## Constants
A list of constants and their values, such as pi, the golden rule, Stefan-Boltzmann constant, etc. 

## Materials

### Metals, Woods, Plastics
